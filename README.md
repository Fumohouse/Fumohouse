An open-source game framework based on Godot that provides fumos as character
models.

Inspired by [Become Fumo](https://www.roblox.com/games/6238705697/Become-Fumo)
and [Scuffed Become
Fumo](https://www.roblox.com/games/7363647365/Scuffed-Become-Fumo).

Fumos are produced by [Gift](https://www.gift-gift.jp/) and designed by
[ANGELTYPE](http://blog.angeltype.under.jp/). Many characters are based on
Touhou Project by Team Shanghai Alice.
