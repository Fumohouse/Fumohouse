# Common Guidelines

## Sign-off

Before starting your contribution, please have a maintainer sign off (i.e.,
approve the idea of) your contribution:

- You may be duplicating someone else's work.
- We may warn you that your submission is likely to be rejected.
- We may want to provide advice on the direction your contribution should take
  (e.g., code structure).

When you are signed off to contribute, others will not be signed off for the
same work. You may not reserve jobs in advance; you must be actively working on
anything you reserve. If we do not receive your submission for a long time, we
may ask you about its status. If you do not respond, others may take over.

## Quality

We expect contributions to meet certain quality standards. In the event that you
do not meet these standards, we will assist you in meeting them.

## Integrity

We expect everyone to create, own, and be accountable for their submission. As
such, submitting work created by a ghost author (someone not on the author list
or copyright declaration), otherwise misrepresenting your submission contents,
or using generative AI in any respect will not be tolerated.
