1. Catch-all capitalization rules:
   | Casing       | For...                                         |
   |--------------|------------------------------------------------|

1. Public interfaces should be documented.
1. Do not use Godot's binary resource formats `.res` or `.scn` unless necessary.

### Formatting and optimization

1. GDScript: Use `gdformat`. For simplicity, always keep the formatter result
   even if it looks bad.
1. SVG: Use `svgo --multipass`.

    Exceptions: For fonts, use the original name from the author.
