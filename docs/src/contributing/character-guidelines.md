# Special Guidelines for Character Models

Make sure you have read the [common](./common-guidelines.md) and
[assets](./assets-guidelines.md) guidelines first.

## Exclusivity

Exclusivity refers to parts only available for use by a limited set of people.
We do not grant exclusivity rights to individuals, even for OCs.

## Modifying or superseding existing models

After sufficient time (at our discretion) has passed after your submission is
accepted, we may accept superseding ("V2") submissions. Your submission will
remain available if a superseding submission is accepted. Submissions
substantially (visually) modifying existing models are accepted only with the
authors' permission.

## Creating your submission

Character submissions should be created with Blender using the provided
character template. If you plan on using existing meshes in your submission,
please coordinate this with us and do not rename the shared parts.

Special instructions and requirements (e.g., for hair meshes) are embedded in
the template file. Please follow these requirements.

You do not need to export your character. A maintainer will handle this for you.

1. Expect timely feedback on your submission. Address any feedback items and
   resubmit files as necessary.
1. Decision: If your submission is approved, expect to be added to the game in a
   timely manner.

   If your submission will be rejected, we will let you know as soon as

   of your submission in a future one.

Feel free to reach out to us in the event of any unexpected delays.
